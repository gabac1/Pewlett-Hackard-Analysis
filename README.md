# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
This analysis aims to demonstrate the scale of the upcoming retirement wave in the institution, and the potential capacity of a possible mentorship program to remedy the "silver tsunami".

## Results:
* The number of senior staffs who are close to retirement, according to the instructed query, is 90399.
* Among which the most retired members are Senior Engineers, with 29414 as the total number.
* Some of the employees however, may not be in the company anymore, thus some modification is needed on the query to clarify this issue.
* The number of eligible individuals for the mentorship program is 1549.

## Summary:
As the instructed query does not take into account the fact that some of the employees are no longer working at the institution, a modified query is used to find out the total number of current employees who fall into the category of retiring as previous defined. The result shows that there are 72458 employees who are currently working at Pewlett-Hackard that would soon retire. Meanwhile, the total number of currently employeed persons is 240124. Thus, over 30% of employees are expected to retire soon. It is clear that the upcoming silver tsunami would have a huge impact on the institution.
On the other hand, for the proposed mentorship program, the total number of employees who are eligible to become a potential mentor is only 1549. This indicates that if the company is aiming at recruiting as many as those who retire, one mentor would be responsible for the training of over 46 new employees. Putting up a feasible plan for this would be a challenge.
Furthermore, the vacancy/mentor ratios are not the same among different departments. For example, each mentor in the Development department would be responsible for 44.57 new trainees, whereas each mentor in the Finance department would be responsible for 56.74 trainees.
